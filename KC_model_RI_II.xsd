                    Every participant in a comparison is entitled to have one result included in the KCDB as long as the NMI is a signatory or designated institute listed in the CIPM MRA and the result is valid (i.e., not older than 20 years).
                    An NMI may withdraw its result only if all other participants agree.
                    The degree of equivalence of a given measurement standard is the degree to which this standard is consistent with the KCRV.
                    The degree of equivalence is expressed quantitatively in terms of the deviation from the key comparison reference value and the expanded uncertainty of this deviation ($k = 2$).
                    The CCRI(II) agrees on the following statement on degree of equivalence evaluated in BIPM.RI(II)-K1 comparisons: 
                        _ The degree of equivalence of the result of a particular NMI, $i$, with the key comparison reference value is expressed as the difference $D_{i}$ between the values $D_{i}=A_{\textrm{e}i}-KCRV$
                        and the expanded uncertainty ($k=2$)  of this difference, $U_{i}$, known as the equivalence uncertainty; hence $U_{i}=2u(D_{i})$.
                        _ When the result of the NMI $i$ is included in the KCRV with a weight $w_{i}$, then $u^{2}(D_{i})=(1-2w_{i})u_i^{2}+u^{2}(KCRV)$.
                        _ However, when the result of the NMI $i$ is not included in the KCRV, then $u^2(D_i)=u_i^2+u^2(KCRV)$.
                        
                    A degree of equivalence is reported with the following elements:
                        _ The laboratory (xml element: "laboratory")
                        _ The degree of equivalence defined by a dsi:real element.
                        This element is expected to contain a value, a multiple of becquerel as unit,
                        and an expanded uncertainty with a coverage factor equal to 2.
                        The becquerel unit is defined in https://si-digital-framework.org/si-unit/Bq

                    In May 2013, the CCRI(II) decided to calculate the KCRV by using the power-moderated weighted mean (PMM).
                    https://doi.org/10.1088/0026-1394/52/3/S200
                    key comparison results can be selected for the KCRV with the following provisions: 
                    _ results for solutions standardized by only primary techniques are accepted, with the exception of radioactive gas standards (for which results from transfer instrument measurements that are directly traceable to a primary measurement in the laboratory may be included); 
                    _ each NMI or other laboratory may use only one result (normally the most recent result or the mean if more than one ampoule is submitted);
                    _ results more than 20 years old are included in the calculation of the KCRV but are not included in data shown in the KCDB or in the plots in this report, as they have expired;Acronym
                    _ possible outliers can be identified on a mathematical basis and excluded from the KCRV using the normalized error test with a test value of 2.5 and using the modified uncertainties;
                    _ results can also be excluded for technical reasons; and
                    _ the CCRI(II) is always the final arbiter regarding excluding any data from the calculation of the KCRV. Although the KCRV may be modified when other NMIs participate, on the advice of the Key Comparison Working Group of the CCRI(II), such modifications are made only by the CCRI(II) during one of its biennial meetings, or by consensus through electronic means (e.g., email) as discussed at the CCRI(II) meeting in 2013.
                                                                
                    The key comparison reference value (KCRV) is defined by a dsi: real element.
                    This element is expected to contain a value, a multiple of becquerel as unit, and a standard uncertainty (a coverage factor equal to 1).
                    The becquerel unit is defined in https://si-digital-framework.org/si-unit/Bq
