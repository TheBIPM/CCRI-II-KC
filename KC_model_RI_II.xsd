                        Key comparison results are key data in the realization of the derived unit becquerel for a given radionuclide.
                        The ultimate semantic reference for this derived SI unit is provided by https://si-digital-framework.org/si-unit/Bq
                        The key comparison results are officially publish on BIPM the Key Comparison DataBase https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/
                        
                        Successful participation in this comparison by a laboratory may provide evidential support for 
                        Calibration and Measurement Capability (CMC) claims for [nuclide] measured using the laboratory’s 
                        method(s) used in the comparison or methods calibrated by those used for the comparison. This
                        comparison may also be used to support CMC claims for those radionuclides measured in the laboratory 
                        using the same method and having a degree of difficulty at or below that of the radionuclide measured 
                        in this comparison as indicated in the current Measurement Methods Matrix (MMM)[1].

                                                                        An NMI may withdraw its result only if all other participants agree.

                                                                        _ The degree of equivalence of the result of a particular NMI, $i$, with the key comparison reference value is expressed as the difference $D_{i}$ between the values $D_{i}=A_{\textrm{e}i}-KCRV$
                                                                            and the expanded uncertainty ($k=2$)  of this difference, $U_{i}$, known as the equivalence uncertainty; hence $U_{i}=2u(D_{i})$.
                                                                        _ When the result of the NMI $i$ is included in the KCRV with a weight $w_{i}$, then $u^{2}(D_{i})=(1-2w_{i})u_i^{2}+u^{2}(KCRV)$.
                                                                        _ However, when the result of the NMI $i$ is not included in the KCRV, then $u^2(D_i)=u_i^2+u^2(KCRV)$.
